# Word counter
Application which enables to count the number of words from events that are grouped by their event type.

# Simplifications and assumptions

* Application is using `IO` effect type instead of tagless final to keep the solution simple
* Data is generated by the `InfiniteRawDataGenerator` which produces either correct JSON data or some random, invalid data (50:50 chances)
* Data is accumulated over 2 seconds time window
* Data that contains incorrectly formatted data is ignored
* Incoming data is mostly ordered by the timestamp
